This is an open-source tagging solution for AWS. Deploy AutoTag to Lambda using CloudTrail consumed through CloudWatch Events and have each of your resources tagged with the ARN of who created it. Optionally, resources can be tagged with when it was created and which AWS service invoked the request if one is provided.  It was written by [GorillaStack](http://www.gorillastack.com/).

[Read a blog post about the project](http://blog.gorillastack.com/gorillastack-presents-auto-tag).

Also see [retro-tag](https://github.com/GorillaStack/retro-tag) for a solution to retrospectively tagging your resources using CloudTrail data.

## About

Automatically tagging resources can greatly improve the ease of cost allocation and governance.

CloudWatch events delivers a near real-time stream of CloudTrail events as soon as a supported resource type is created. CloudWatch event rules triggers our AutoTag code to tag the resource. In this configuration the Lambda function is executed once each time it is triggered by the CloudWatch Event Rule (one event at a time). The CloudWatch Event Rule includes a pattern filter so it is only triggered by the supported events, meaning fewer Lambda invocations and lower operational costs.

## Installation

The infrastructure consists of:

* S3 Bucket
* Main CloudFormation Stack (1 AWS region)
  * Lambda Function
  * IAM Role
* Collector CloudFormation Stack (All active AWS regions)
  * CloudWatch Events Rule
  * SNS Topic

## Prerequisites

You will need at least 1 AWS Account, and CloudTrail should be enabled.

## Deployment Methods

We have documented two different ways to deploy the infrastructure to your account. Since there are CloudFormation stacks that need to be deployed in multiple regions we've provided a script that uses the AWS CLI to deploy everything for you. The other deployment method has more steps and uses CloudFormation StackSets to deploy across multiple regions.

### Script Deployment Method: Deploy through our script

This deploy script `deploy_autotag.sh` will create, delete, or update all of the AutoTag infrastructure for a single AWS account.

The script will attempt to auto-install its own dependencies: `aws-cli`, `jq`, `npm`, `git`, `zip`

The `create` command will start by creating a dedicated AutoTag S3 Bucket for storing code deployment packages in your AWS account. Then it will download or build the code package, and create both the main CloudFormation stack and the collector CloudFormation stacks. When executing the `delete` command all resources will be removed except the S3 bucket.

#### Credentials

The deploy script can use all of the credential providers that the AWS CLI allows, see [Configure AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) and take a look at the examples below. A separate set of CLI credentials can be provided by the argument `--s3-profile` for utilizing a single S3 bucket when deploying infrastructure across multiple AWS accounts. The script will also secure the S3 bucket by blocking all public access configuration, and add the required S3 bucket-policy statement to allow the cross-account `GetObject` access if necessary. 

#### IAM Policy

The script needs at minimum these IAM permissions: [deploy\_iam\_policy.json](deploy_iam_policy.json)

If you are going to use the policy replace the 2 occurrences of `my-autotag-bucket` with the name of your actual AutoTag S3 bucket.

#### Commands and Options

```text
Usage: deploy_autotag.sh [options] <command>

Commands:
    create                    Create the AutoTag infrastructure
    delete                    Delete the AutoTag infrastructure
    update-release            Update the AutoTag infrastructure with a specific release version
    update-master             Update the AutoTag infrastructure with the latest from the master branch
    update-local              Update the AutoTag infrastructure with the local source code

Options:
    -h   --help                  Show this screen
    -r   --region                The primary AWS region where the main CloudFormation stack will be deployed
    -p   --profile               The main AWS credential profile
    -s3bu --s3-bucket            The S3 bucket where the code package will be uploaded
    -s3pr --s3-profile           A separate AWS credential profile to upload code packages to the S3 Bucket
    -rv   --release-version      The release version to deploy, e.g. '0.5.2' or 'latest'
    
    -lr   --log-retention-days   The number of days to retain the Lambda Function's logs (default: 90)
    -ld   --log-level-debug      Enable the debug logging for the Lambda Function
    -ct   --disable-create-time  Disable the 'CreateTime' tagging for all AWS resources
    -ib   --disable-invoked-by   Disable the 'InvokedBy' tagging for all AWS resources
```

#### Preparation

Follow these steps to prepare to run the `create` command.

1. Select a primary AWS `--region` for the S3 bucket and the Main CloudFormation stack
2. Pick a dedicated AutoTag `--s3-bucket` name, e.g. 'acme-autotag'
3. Configure AWS credentials for the AWS CLI, see [Configure AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

#### Deployment

Download the latest version of `deploy_autotag.sh`, or find it in the root of the repository.

```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GorillaStack/auto-tag/master/deploy_autotag.sh
chmod +x deploy_autotag.sh
```

Create the infrastructure with the latest release using either the `default`, `$AWS_PROFILE`, or `instance` AWS credentials profile.

```bash
./deploy_autotag.sh --region us-west-2 --s3-bucket my-autotag-bucket --release-version latest create
```

Create the infrastructure with the latest release using a named AWS credentials profile.

```bash
./deploy_autotag.sh --region us-west-2 --s3-bucket my-autotag-bucket --release-version latest --profile dev-acct create
```

Create the infrastructure using `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYY
./deploy_autotag.sh --region us-west-2 --s3-bucket my-autotag-bucket create
```

Create the infrastructure using a named AWS credentials profile (`--profile`), but with the S3 Bucket operations utilizing a separate AWS credential profile (`--s3-profile`). Use this feature to deploy across multiple accounts using a single S3 bucket.

```bash
./deploy_autotag.sh --region us-west-2 --s3-bucket my-autotag-bucket --profile dev-acct --s3-profile s3-acct create
```

Update the infrastructure to the bleeding edge (master).

```bash
./deploy_autotag.sh --region us-west-2 --s3-bucket my-autotag-bucket update-master
```

Update the infrastructure to the latest git release.

```bash
./deploy_autotag.sh --region us-west-2 --s3-bucket my-autotag-bucket  --release-version latest update-release
```

Update the infrastructure to a specific git release - *only works for releases >= 0.5.1*.

```bash
./deploy_autotag.sh --region us-west-2 --s3-bucket my-autotag-bucket --release-version 0.5.2 update-release
```

Update the infrastructure to the local git folder's current state.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GorillaStack/auto-tag.git
cd auto-tag
./deploy_autotag.sh --region us-west-2 --s3-bucket my-autotag-bucket update-local
```

Delete the infrastructure.

```bash
./deploy_autotag.sh --region us-west-2 delete
```

### StackSet Deployment Method: Deploy using CloudFormation StackSets

_*=not tested by the test suite_

NOTE: When tag-able resources are created using CloudFormation __StackSets__ the "Creator" tag is NEVER populated with the ARN of the user who executed the StackSet, instead it is tagged with the less useful CloudFormation StackSet Execution Role's "assumed-role" ARN. 

## Deny Create/Delete/Edit for AutoTags

Use the following IAM policy to deny a user or role the ability to create, delete, and edit any tag starting with 'AutoTag\_'. The `ec2:CreateAction` condition allows users to create EC2 instances with tags starting with 'AutoTag_', this enables the 'Launch More Like This' feature, in that case the tags will be overwritten after the instance is created.

```json
{
    "Sid": "DenyAutoTagPrefix",
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": [
        "ec2:CreateTags",
        "ec2:DeleteTags",
        "autoscaling:CreateOrUpdateTags",
        "autoscaling:DeleteTags"
    ],
    "Condition": {
        "ForAnyValue:StringLike": {
            "aws:TagKeys": "AutoTag_*"
        },
        "StringNotEquals": {
            "ec2:CreateAction": [
                "RunInstances"
            ]
        }
    },
    "Resource": "*"
}
```

NOTE: At the time of this writing the deny tag IAM condition (aws:TagKeys) is only available for resources in EC2 and AutoScaling, see the table above for a status of each resource.
